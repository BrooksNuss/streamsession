for the final connection setup, storing a user's connection by using req.ip and then using that to send them the room/currently connected users info.

when a new user connects to the room, broadcast a message to all connected users with the new user's info, so each of the clients can make a connection to the new user.

store the client's connections in an array. Maybe one for incoming, one for outgoing. OR have an array of objects, each object has a name, an outgoing connection and an incoming connection.

look into socket.io more, and start writing server code. once that's done, work on integrating the client code with it.

client connects then all other clients send the new client an offer.
